## Features:

* Basic mod viewing - will display any mod installed, whether it has modern manifest information or is a basic mod, as well as displaying info for the vanilla game.
* Config modifications - allows the user to customise any mods that provide a set of configs in the manifest.
* Update checking - any mod that supplies appropriate updater information will have any updates scanned at launch. Updates can be downloaded individually, as a group, or ignored for the version.
* Conflict and dependancy checks - any mod that provides mod IDs for mods that are required or don't work with will show a warning on the title screen. NOTE: This only works for mods with manifests.
* Tag & search filters - lets you filter the displayed mods by keyword or mod ID, or choose from a set of tags contained with mods to display only mods using a specific set of tags
